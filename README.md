# On-campus Hands-on Lab Sessions

---

## Goals:

- To practice and gain experience with real design, programming, and prototyping on FPGA of a relatively simple Embedded Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC). This MPSoC is based on some of the embedded application and platform models discussed in the lectures.
- To learn how to use advanced academic and industrial software tools to design embedded systems.

## Format:

- Design, programming, and implementation of an MPSoC using very advanced academic and industrial software tools.

## Software Tools:

- The DAEDALUS framework (academic research framework for system-level design developed by the LERC group at LIACS).
- Xilinx Platform Studio (industrial tool for implementation and prototyping on FPGAs).
- Your tutor will explain you how to get access and use the tools.
